# Batch Exporting ZONES

This is the easiest one :D You do not need AHK for this batch process.

The `Zones/Zone_**.txt` files you see in this directory are basically built from this list: https://www.reddit.com/r/ffximodding/comments/9ndg2d/complete_list_of_zone_dats_by_zone_id/

I have split them into files per expansion.

### Setup

Edit the following file: `Armor_PHP_Batch_Settings.php`

Change all the paths and arguments to your liking.

### Batch Exporting

Once you've modified it how you like, run the PHP Code like so:

- `php Zones_PHP_Batch_Export.php`

This uses `?cmode` and will do everything for you, you can still use your PC.
