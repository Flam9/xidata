# FFXI Batch App

This tool was created to automate the batch exporting of FFXI content via Noesis and ensuring a consistent format, structure and output for Game/3D Development.

> Note: **Once you set your settings, when you launch the app again it will take a couple seconds as it builds a local data list of JSON files to make batch export simplier**

**Features include**

- Full automation of ff11datsets
- Handling noemultifbx to split animations with correct frame length
- Correct skeletons for gear
- Managing data extract using Altana Lists.

All source code is available. Download the current version in the Releases secton.
