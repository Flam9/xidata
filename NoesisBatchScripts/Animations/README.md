# Animations

todo - write about this!

This is still a work in progress, the Anims_PHP_Batch_Export.php simply read the CSVs and build out a `ff11datset` for every single animation. The `AnimsBasic` Have been custom made and might miss some stuff.

todo - write a AHK processing script that will include the Anim Name, the ff11datset file and where to save it. This will be very very similar to **NPC**
